# fe_web, a PWA

## Todo
 * Look into GraphQL again. It could simplify a lot.
 * Think about implementation of storage. I will need both local & server storage.
    * IndexedDB looks like a good local impl.
    * One class for all storage, or segment per deck, progress, etc?
    * Should have one class for each of local & server probably.
